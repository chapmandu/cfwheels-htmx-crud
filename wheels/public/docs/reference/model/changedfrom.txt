// Get a member object and change the `email` property on it
member = model("member").findByKey(params.memberId);
member.email = params.newEmail;

// Get the previous value (what the `email` property was before it was changed)
oldValue = member.changedFrom("email");

// The above can also be done using a dynamic function like this
oldValue = member.emailChangedFrom();
